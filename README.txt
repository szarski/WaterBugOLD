This is an old version. The new one is being developed here:

http://github.com/szarski/WaterBug


Place this on the bottom of your layout:


<script type="text/javascript" src="waterbug.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">WaterBug.load();</script>

where waterbug.js should be replaced with an url to the waterbug.js file.

The script requires prototype javascript library, so you have to include it too.

Feel free to fork and modify as long as you keep this info bundled!
